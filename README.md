-----------------
To create an AI-driven CRM system that includes both text and voice-based assistants, smart contract development, and seamless integration, you'll need to leverage several technologies. Below is a Python-based framework with a focus on the AI Assistant development and basic smart contract creation. The system will involve integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), voice recognition, and smart contract logic for automation.
Requirements:

    Natural Language Processing: We'll use libraries such as spaCy, transformers for NLP tasks.
    Voice Assistant: For text-to-speech and speech recognition, we'll use speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries.
    Smart Contracts: We can integrate web3.py for interacting with Ethereum-based smart contracts.
    CRM System: We'll use a database like SQLite or a more advanced option like PostgreSQL, and integrate it with AI-powered features.

First, install the required libraries:

pip install spacy transformers speechrecognition pyttsx3 web3 sqlite3

Python Code for AI Solutions Developer Role:

Below is an example of how to set up a framework for AI assistants (both text and voice), develop smart contracts, and start building a CRM system.
1. Text-Based AI Assistant with NLP (Using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers)

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained transformer model for text generation (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-2)
chatbot = pipeline("conversational", model="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")

def get_text_response(user_input):
    """
    Get response from the AI assistant based on user input.
    """
    response = chatbot(user_input)
    return response[0]['generated_text']

# Test the text-based AI Assistant
user_input = "Hello, how can I improve my business efficiency?"
response = get_text_response(user_input)
print(f"AI Assistant: {response}")

2. Voice-Based AI Assistant (Using speech_recognition and pyttsx3 for TTS)

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the recognizer and text-to-speech engine
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    """
    Convert text to speech.
    """
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

def listen_for_audio():
    """
    Listen to the user and return the audio input.
    """
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
        try:
            user_input = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            print(f"You said: {user_input}")
            return user_input
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            speak("Sorry, I did not understand. Could you repeat?")
            return None
        except sr.RequestError:
            speak("Sorry, there was an issue with the speech service.")
            return None

# Example: Voice interaction
while True:
    user_input = listen_for_audio()
    if user_input:
        response = get_text_response(user_input)  # Get response from text-based AI
        print(f"AI Assistant: {response}")
        speak(response)
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        break

3. Smart Contract (Ethereum) Development (Using Web3.py)

This example assumes you have access to an Ethereum wallet and a test network like Rinkeby or Ropsten for testing the contract.

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to the Ethereum test network (Rinkeby in this case)
infura_url = "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(infura_url))

# Check if connected
if web3.isConnected():
    print("Connected to Ethereum Network")

# Example of a simple Smart Contract (ERC-20 Token)
contract_abi = '''[
    {
        "constant": true,
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "totalSupply",
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "payable": false,
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
]'''
contract_address = "0xYourContractAddress"

contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

# Function to interact with the smart contract
def get_total_supply():
    supply = contract.functions.totalSupply().call()
    print(f"Total Supply of Token: {supply}")
    
get_total_supply()

4. Basic CRM System (SQLite for Database Integration)

For a CRM system, we can use SQLite for storage and integrate with AI systems to provide automated suggestions, track conversations, etc.

import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it)
conn = sqlite3.connect('crm_system.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a simple CRM table (customer records, conversations, etc.)
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT,
                    email TEXT,
                    phone TEXT,
                    last_interaction TEXT
                )''')

# Function to add a customer record
def add_customer(name, email, phone, last_interaction):
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone, last_interaction) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (name, email, phone, last_interaction))
    conn.commit()

# Function to fetch customer data
def get_customer_data(name):
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = ?", (name,))
    customer = cursor.fetchone()
    if customer:
        return customer
    else:
        return "Customer not found."

# Add a new customer to the CRM
add_customer('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '+123456789', '2023-08-25')

# Retrieve and display customer information
customer = get_customer_data('John Doe')
print(f"Customer Data: {customer}")

# Closing the database connection
conn.close()

Integration and Workflow:

    AI Assistant (Text and Voice):
        Text-based assistants (using Hugging Face) provide conversational responses.
        Voice-based assistants (using speech_recognition and pyttsx3) enable voice interactions.
    Smart Contract:
        Use Web3.py to interact with Ethereum-based contracts for automation and transparency.
    CRM System:
        Store customer data, track interactions, and integrate AI to suggest improvements based on the conversation history.

Next Steps:

    Enhance CRM: Implement a full-fledged CRM by adding functionalities like tracking leads, scheduling follow-ups, and integrating with other platforms like email or Slack.
    Voice Assistant for CRM: Allow voice commands to add customers, schedule interactions, or fetch customer data via voice.
    Deploy the Chatbot: Integrate the chatbot with a web platform (e.g., using Flask or Django) to allow customers to interact via chat.
    Smart Contract Automation: Integrate smart contracts for automating business processes such as payments, agreements, and transaction tracking.

This solution provides a versatile, AI-powered digital solution, which can be further expanded with additional features like AI-enhanced analytics, advanced CRM functionalities, and more sophisticated smart contract automation.
